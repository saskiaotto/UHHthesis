<!-- If you'd like to include a comment in the R Markdown file that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this (note that comments in code chunks and the YAML header are marked with a # instead-->

# Settings in the YAML Header {-}
<!-- (Note: The {-} here means that this section header will be unnumbered -->

This section provides an overview of the options and settings in the YAML (*YAML Ain't Markup Language*) header. You can delete this section later.

- This .Rmd file is the actual R Markdown file, which needs to be knitted to render the entire thesis. It is important that you name this file `index.Rmd`, otherwise you'll run into an error. All other .Rmd file in this thesis folder (i.e. all the prelim and chapter files) **should not** be knitted!
- In the above YAML header (which none of the other .Rmd file have) all necessary settings are made including some dummy text for the title page, which you need to adjust to your thesis. Please note that if you run into knitting problems, spacing in the YAML header might be the cause.
- The list of references you cite in your thesis can either be copied into the 'bib/references.bib' file, which is provided above as default bibliography or you replace this file name with your own file(s). The reference style can defined by providing a .csl file. This template uses the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style, provided by the 'bib/sage-harvard.csl' file. But you cna replace this style file with any other .csl file. For more information see also [Citation and reference list].
- Hyperlinks: you can change the default colors for internal links (incl. ToC), external links, citation links, and linked URLs by adding the YAML fields `linkcolor`, `filecolor`, `citecolor`, or `urlcolor` and providing the name of a LaTeX color, e.g. `linkcolor: red`.
- The actual function to create this thesis is `UHHthesis::thesis_pdf_en`. It allows for a few more settings such as including or excluding a table of content (see also the function documentations). You can set them as follows:

```
output:
  UHHthesis::thesis_pdf_en:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 5
    highlight: default
```
The default settings of `toc`, `toc_depth`, and `highlight` are shown here but don't have to be set in the YAML header unless you want to change them. For further options that can be defined here see the documentation of the `bookdown::pdf_book` function, which is internally called. 


The content of the section *Abstract*, *Zusammenfassung*, and *List of Abbreviations* has to be provided in individual .Rmd files located in the folder `prelim/`, i.e.

- `00-abstract.Rmd`
- `00-zusammenfassung.Rmd`
- `00-abbreviations.Rmd`

All other chapters have their own .Rmd file within the `chapter/` folder:

- `01-intro.Rmd`
- `02-methods.Rmd`
- `03-results.Rmd`
- `04-discussion.Rmd`
- `96-references.Rmd`
- `97-appendix.Rmd`
- `98-acknowledge.Rmd`
- `99-declaration.Rmd`

The order of all sections and chapters is determined in the `_bookdown.yml` file. If you want to add more chapters, simply create a new .Rmd file in the `chapter/` folder following the same naming convention as the other files and add its file name to the `_bookdown.yml` file.

If you want to learn more on how to modify this template or about PDF books made with `bookdown` (which is the basis for this template) in general, I highly recommend the online book [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)!
