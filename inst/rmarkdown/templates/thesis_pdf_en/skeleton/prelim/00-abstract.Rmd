# Abstract {-}

The abstract comes always first and should raise the readers interest in reading further.

The abstract summarizes, usually in one or two paragraph (here max. 1 page), the major aspects of the entire thesis in a prescribed sequence. This should include:

- the overall purpose of the study and the research problem(s) you investigated
- the basic design of the study
- the major findings or trends found as a result of your analysis
- a brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions.
