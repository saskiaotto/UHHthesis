# Introduction

The Bachelor and Master thesis can be written in German or English. The number of pages should correspond to the workload of the Bachelor (12LP) or Master (30LP) thesis (if necessary, consult your supervisor). The thesis is to be submitted in single copy (bound; no spiral binding) and as a PDF to the Academic Office via email or on a USB stick.  

## Thesis structure and format

The thesis should consist of the following sections, which have already been outlined in this template:

1. **Title page** [is created automatically via the YAML header]
2. **Table of Contents** [is created automatically here]
3. **Summary** in English (i.e., the **Abstract**) and German [see files in the `prelim/` folder].
4. **List of Abbreviations** (optional) [see file in `prelim/` folder]
5. **List of Tables** and **List of Figures** (optional) [will be created automatically if YAML header `lot: true` and `lof: true` stops]
6. **Introduction** [see file in the `chapter/` folder].
7. **Material and Methods** [see file in the `chapter/` folder]
8. **Results** [see file in the `chapter/` folder]
9. **Discussion** [see file in the `chapter/` folder]
10. **References** [this section is automatically filled with references from the two files 'references.bib' and 'packages.bib' in the `bib/` folder, which must be explicitly specified in the YAML header; the 'references.bib' file must be manually filled with the cited literature sources, the file 'packages.bib', which contains the software references, is automatically created by the code snippet 'generate-package-refs' in the 'index.Rmd' file.]
11. **Appendix** (optional) [see file in the `chapter/` folder]
12. **Acknowledgement** (optional) [see file in `chapter/` folder]
13. **Declaration of Authorship** (obligatory) - don't forget the date and signature here [see file in `chapter/` folder]

The following format should be followed: Font size 12 Times New Roman, line spacing 1.5, page margins each 2.5cm, upper margin 2.5cm, lower margin 2.0cm. This is already defined in this template so you don't have to bother with!


## Content of the introduction

The introduction consists of the problem definition, its relevance as well as the objectives and structure of the work. The introduction should start more broadly and then move to the more specific topics of your study. The following questions should be answered in brief form:

- What is the general topic?
- What is the specific question of the work, what is the goal? Why is the question important?
- How was the question dealt with in the literature so far? 
- Which hypothesis is tested in the present work?
- How is the following text structured? (chain of argumentation, subproblems)


## Literature

The selection and use of relevant academic literature is an important part of any thesis and scientific publication.

### Literature research

When searching for literature, it is recommended to start with the given introductory literature and the references cited therein. Many titles can be easily searched and found via [Web of Science](https://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=E4BQAzXmvUw7kPeUIBE&preferencesSaved=) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/). The number of citations can provide a useful indication of the relevance of a certain publication. Note, that the Web of Science database can only be accessed from the university or from home via a [VPN](https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/services/netz/vpn.html) client.


Important literature sources are

1. reference books, standards
2. scientific articles
3. conference proceedings
4. university theses
4. technical reports, grey literature
5. online material

Further important literature databases in biology are among others

- the [Electronic Journals Library of the University of Hamburg](https://www.sub.uni-hamburg.de/recherche/elektronische-zeitschriftenbibliothek.html) (ECB) 
- the [Digital Library](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/service/bibliotheken/bibliothek-fachbereichsbibliothek/digibib.html) of the Departmental Library of the UHH Biology
- the [Virtual Library of Biology](http://www.vifabio.de/) (vifabio) of the [University Library Johann Christian Senckenberg](https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/)
- the catalogues and databases listed in vifabio: http://www.vifabio.de/howto/info/icatalogs.html
- [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com)


### Citation and bibliography

The following applies to all scientific work: Wherever possible, reference should be made to other relevant publications instead of reproducing their content. A references must be given for all statements and representations that originate from publications. Whenever content from external sources is paraphrased or literally interpreted, the source must be indicated at the text passage. It is not sufficient to include the source in the bibliography. Literal interpretations are to be put in quotation marks.

The program BibTeX is used here to create the bibliography. The advantage of BibTeX or any other literature database is that all citations and source references in the entire document are automatically detected and assigned to the corresponding reference in the literature database. The 'references.bib' file referred to in the YAML header represents this literature database. The file is a so-called plain-text file, which contains bibliographic entries in the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
@article{May1976,
   author = {May, R. M.},
   title = {Simple mathematical models with very 
     complicated dynamics},
   journal = {Nature},
   volume = {261},
   number = {5560},
   pages = {459-467},
   ISSN = {0028-0836},
   DOI = {10.1038/261459a0},
   url = {<Go to ISI>://WOS:A1976BT72500018},
   year = {1976},
   type = {Journal Article}
}
```

A single entry always starts with `@type{`, where the type can be an `article`, `book`, `manual`, `techreport`, `inproceedings`, `phdthesis` or `misc` (for e.g. multimedia types, computer programs). More information about the possible types as well as the individual fields such as `author`, `title`, etc. can be found at https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX. After the type and the curly opening bracket comes the 'citation key'. To cite one of these entries or references the @ character is followed by this key, e.g.

- `@May1976` --> becomes @May1976
- `[@May1976]` --> becomes [@May1976]

Note, when placing the citation key inside of square brackets, the name of the author appears in the round brackets together with the year.

In the R Markdown file, for example, you would write "`@May1976` could show that simple population models can trigger complex chaotic dynamics", which is translated in the PDF/LaTeX document to "@May1976 could show ...". All references automatically get a hyperlink to the bibliography. If this is not desired, add `link-citation: false` to the YAML header.

Multiple cited references are separated with a semicolon, e.g. [@kamm2000; @May1976; @RN410].

The formatting of the bibliography is variable. The BibTeX style set in the document determines which information is displayed in which format. The style is defined in the YAML header via the .csl file. CSL stands for *Citation Style Language* and is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies. Instead of the current [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) style any other style can be used by replacing the .csl file in the YAML header. There is a repository on GitHub that provides a variety of .csl files for the different styles: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles.

To facilitate the organization, sharing, and citation of scientific articles and PDF documents in this thesis as well as future research projects, it is recommended to use a literature management program or reference manager such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) from the beginning. These programs easily create the needed .bib file for this thesis or other publications.

There is also the package [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) which I highly recommend: `citr` provides functions and an RStudio add-in to search a BibTeX-file to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document. If you are using Zotero the add-in can access your reference database directly.
