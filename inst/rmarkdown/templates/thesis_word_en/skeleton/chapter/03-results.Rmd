# Results

The result chapter is of great importance in an empirical study and should comprise a good mix of text, tables and figures. Use your research questions and hypothesis for structuring this chapter to provide the reader some structure and to not lose the thread.

Figures and tables should be continuously numbered and referred to in the main text.  LaTeX places figures and tables automatically were they fit best, which is sometimes on the next page. This is fine since they are cross-referenced anyway.
  
Tables have generally a caption at the top, while figures have a caption at the bottom. This has to be considered in some of the R functions (see below).


## Tables

### R Markdown table

When writing a table using R Markdown syntax, as shown in the following table, the table caption is defined right before with **Table: ...**. (*Attention: You do not need quotation marks here!*)

Table: This is a table written in R Markdown.

| A            | New              | Table          |
|:-------------|:----------------:|---------------:|
|left-aligned  |center-aligned    |right-aligned   |
|$123          |$456              |$789            |
|*italics*     |normal            |**boldface**    |

The current **disadvantage** of tables written in R Markdown syntax in the Word document version is the lack of any numbering. Also cross-referencing based on LaTeX notation is not possible. Both are currently only available when creating tables using R (see next section).


### Tables generated with R

Creating tables with R and packages like 'knitr' is much easier (and protects against typing errors!) than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting them into Excel or LaTeX. This shows once again how beautiful reproducible documents can be! 

Another advantage is that tables generated with R automatically receive a number and can be cross-referenced. To do this, simply assign a label for the R code chunk (directly after the '{r'). The cross-reference is then made with `\@ref{tab:code-chunk-label}`.

#### Using the `knitr` package

Table \@ref(tab:kable1) is an example of using `knitr::kable()` to generate the table. The function has an explicit argument named `caption` where you can place your caption text.

```{r kable1}
# Import dataset from the data/ folder
mtcars <- read.csv("data/mtcars.csv")

# Plot only a subset of the data
df <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
knitr::kable(
  df, 
  caption = "This is a table produced with knitr::kable().",
  longtable = TRUE,
  booktabs = TRUE
) 
# (the last two options make the table a bit more readable)
```


#### The `huxtable` package

If you are interested in further table adaptations for Word output, I highly recommend a look at the R package ['huxtable'](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/index.html). Table \@ref(tab:huxtable) is an example of a table representation with 'huxtable':

```{r huxtable}
df <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
ht <- as_hux(df, add_rownames = "model")
ht <- set_outer_borders(ht, 0.4)
bold(ht)[1,]           <- TRUE
bottom_border(ht)[1,]  <- 0.4
align(ht)[,2:7]          <- 'right'
align(ht)[,1]          <- 'left'
number_format(ht)      <- 2
width(ht)              <- 1
caption(ht)            <- "Overview of the first lines and columns in the mtcars dataset."

ht
```


## Figures

Figures can directly be produced with R and displayed here. Similar to external images, figure captions and labels are placed inside the chunk options for cross-referencing (see Fig. \@ref(fig:base-fig)).

```{r base-fig, fig.cap = "Relationship between horsepower and fuel economy."}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
xlab = "Gross Horsepower",
ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",
pch = 19)
abline(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars), col = "red")
```

Here for comparison a boxplot with a different image height (Fig. \@ref(fig:boxplot-fig)).

```{r boxplot-fig, fig.cap = "Fuel differences between transmission types (0 = automatic, 1 = manual).", fig.height = 3}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, mtcars)
```
